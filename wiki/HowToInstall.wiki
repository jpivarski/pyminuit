The first part of this page describes installation on a Linux or Mac OS X computer; the second part describes installation under Windows.

==Linux and Mac Installation Overview==

Conceptually, there are three steps to install !PyMinuit on your
computer.  

    # Unpack and compile Minuit-1_7_9.
    # Compile and install minuit.so.
    # Make sure that Python can find the library.

The `setup.py` disttools script should take care of the first two steps,
and the third may be automatic.

Here are instructions that have been tested on Linux (Ubuntu Dapper
Drake).  They will probably work Mac OS X.

===System-wide installation===

If you have superuser privileges (root access), you can install !PyMinuit on your whole system using the default installation script.  Change directories to your unpacked pyminuit distribution and type

{{{
% python setup.py install
}}}

(without the `%` command prompt).

If that didn't work, follow the home-directory installation.

===Home-directory installation===

If not, you'll have to install Minuit-1_7_9 and pyminuit in your home directory.  This will create a ~/lib directory, if one doesn't already exist.  First, change directories to your unpacked pyminuit distribution, then

  * Unpack, compile, and install Minuit-1_7_9:
{{{
% tar -xzvf Minuit-1_7_9.tar.gz
% cd Minuit-1_7_9
% ./configure --prefix=~/lib
% make
% make install
}}}
(You might not be allowed to use the `~` shortcut.)  _(To do: make setup.py smart enough to set the prefix when it configures Minuit, so that the user doesn't have to do it by hand!)_

  * Go back to your pyminuit directory and install in ~/lib
{{{
% cd ..
% python setup.py install --home=~
}}}

  * Test the installation with
{{{
% python
Python 2.4.3 (#2, Oct  6 2006, 07:52:30) 
[GCC 4.0.3 (Ubuntu 4.0.3-1ubuntu5)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import minuit
}}}
(There should be no error messages.)

  * Make sure Python can find your library, no matter what directory you start it from: add one of the following to your login script
{{{
export PYTHONPATH=~/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
}}}
or
{{{
setenv PYTHONPATH ~/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
}}}

(You might not be allowed to use the `~` shortcut.)

===If something goes wrong===

If you have any suggestions for improving the installation process,
please add it to [http://code.google.com/p/pyminuit/issues/list my issues list].

Be sure to tell me whether the following files exist:
{{{
.../pyminuit/Minuit-1_7_9
.../pyminuit/Minuit-1_7_9/src/.libs/liblcg_Minuit.*
.../pyminuit/build
~/lib/liblcg_Minuit*
~/lib/python/minuit.so
/usr/lib/liblcg_Minuit*
/usr/lib/python/minuit.so
}}}
and whether you are attempting a system-wide installation or a home-directory installation.

==Windows Installations==

|| I want to thank Jette for these Windows-installation instructions! ||

Unlike Linux (and now the Mac), Windows doesn't come with a built-in compiler, so we'll need to download one.  The following is sufficient:

  * [http://www.mingw.org/ MinGW] a minimal set of Gnu tools, including the Gnu compiler
  * [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435 MSYS] you only need to download "msysCORE-1.0.11-20071204.tar.bz2"

Unpack these and add the new MSYS/bin directory to your Windows PATH variable.  (Right click on My computer, choose Properties, Advanced, Environment Variables.  In the lower list choose to edit the variable named Path and add the path to your MSYS\bin.)

!PyMinuit comes in two parts: the Minuit libraries themselves and the Python wrapper.  Under Windows, you need to install and compile these both separately, by hand.  Here's how to do that.

Download and unpack !PyMinuit.  If you do it directly on the `C:\` drive, you will get a folder named `C:\pyminuit`

In `C:\pyminuit` find `Minuit-1_7_9.tar.gz` and unpack it into `C:\pyminuit\Minuit-1_7_9`

Open a command prompt, change directories to `C:\pyminuit\Minuit-1_7_9`, and compile it with the following commands.

{{{
C:\pyminuit\Minuit-1_7_9>sh configure
C:\pyminuit\Minuit-1_7_9>make
C:\pyminuit\Minuit-1_7_9>make install
}}}

Now change directories to `C:\pyminuit` and compile !PyMinuit:

{{{
C:\pyminuit\Minuit-1_7_9>cd ..
C:\pyminuit\>python setup.py install build -c mingw32
}}}

You may need to set your PYTHONPATH variable to include `C:\pyminuit` (same method as for PATH).
