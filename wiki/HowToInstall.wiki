The first part of this page describes installation on a Linux or Mac OS X computer; the second part describes installation under Windows.

==Linux and Mac Installation Overview==

Conceptually, there are three steps to install !PyMinuit on your
computer.  

    # Unpack and compile Minuit-1_7_9.
    # Compile and install minuit.so.
    # Make sure that Python can find the library.

The `setup.py` disttools script should take care of the first two steps,
and the third may be automatic.

Here are instructions that have been tested on Linux (Ubuntu Dapper
Drake).  They will probably work Mac OS X.

===Run the `setup.py` script===

If you have access to your Python distribution (as root superuser or
because you installed Python yourself), just run

{{{
% python setup.py install
}}}

(without the `%` command prompt).  If you need to install !PyMinuit in
your home directory, use this option:

{{{
% python setup.py install --home=~
}}}

(or replace `~` with the directory of choice).  This latter option
creates a `lib/python` directory for local Python modules.

For more on Python distutils, see [http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html the distutils tutorial].

===Make sure Python can find your library===

If you installed your library in the standard location (no `--home`
switch), Python should be able to find it automatically.  Test it with

{{{
% python
Python 2.4.3 (#2, Oct  6 2006, 07:52:30) 
[GCC 4.0.3 (Ubuntu 4.0.3-1ubuntu5)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import minuit
}}}

(There should be no error messages.)

If you installed it in a different location (e.g. `--home=~`), find the
library by hand,

{{{
% ls ~/lib/python/minuit.so 
}}}

and add this path to your `PYTHONPATH` variable.  In your login script,
add something like

{{{
export PYTHONPATH=~/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
}}}
or
{{{
setenv PYTHONPATH ~/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
}}}

(You might not be allowed to use the `~` shortcut.)

===If something goes wrong===

The `setup.py` script attempts to unpack `Minuit-1_7_9.tar.gz` with the
`tar` command, configure it with `./configure`, and compile it with
`make`.  If this is not appropriate for your system, untar, configure,
and compile by hand.  The setup.py script will not attempt to compile
an already-compiled `Minuit-1_7_9`.

If you have any suggestions for improving the installation process,
please add it to [http://code.google.com/p/pyminuit/issues/list my issues list].

==Windows Installations==

|| I want to thank Jette for these Windows-installation instructions! ||

Unlike Linux (and now the Mac), Windows doesn't come with a built-in compiler, so we'll need to download one.  The following is sufficient:

  * [[http://www.mingw.org/][!MinGW]] a minimal set of Gnu tools, including the Gnu compiler
  * [[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435][!MSYS]] you only need to download "msysCORE-1.0.11-20071204.tar.bz2"

Unpack these and add the new MSYS/bin directory to your Windows PATH variable.  (This is a `set` statement in a batch script--- you need to be familiar with using shell variables on the Windows command prompt to do it.)

!PyMinuit comes in two parts: the Minuit libraries themselves and the Python wrapper.  Under Windows, you need to install and compile these both separately, by hand.  Here's how to do that.

Download and unpack !PyMinuit.  If you do it directly on the `C:\` drive, you will get a folder named `C:\pyminuit`

In `C:\pyminuit` find `Minuit-1_7_9.tar.gz` and unpack it into `C:\pyminuit\Minuit-1_7_9`

Open a command prompt, change directories to `C:\pyminuit\Minuit-1_7_9`, and compile it with the following commands.  (Jim Pivarski's comment: I don't think the `make install` is necessary, but I haven't done it myself.)

{{{
C:\pyminuit\Minuit-1_7_9>sh configure
C:\pyminuit\Minuit-1_7_9>make
C:\pyminuit\Minuit-1_7_9>make install
}}}

Now change directories to `C:\pyminuit` and compile !PyMinuit:

{{{
C:\pyminuit\Minuit-1_7_9>cd ..
C:\pyminuit\>python setup.py install build -c mingw32
}}}

You may need to set your PYTHONPATH variable to include `C:\pyminuit` with a `set` statement in a batch script.

Good luck!
